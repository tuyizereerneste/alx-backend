0x01. Caching

Caching involves storing copies of frequently accessed data in a location that can be accessed more quickly than fetching the data from its original source. This helps improve the performance and responsiveness of applications by reducing the time it takes to retrieve data.

At the end of this project, I'm expected to explain the following concepts of caching systems:

	- What a caching system is
	- What FIFO means
	- What LIFO means
	- What LRU means
	- What MRU means
	- What LFU means
	- What the purpose of a caching system
	- What limits a caching system have?
